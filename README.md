# 🎨 Paintings by the mother to be

Welcome to our small online gallery! We're sharing a few of my wife's paintings with close friends and family. These works were created with love over the past few years, and now we're parting with some of them to make room in our apartment — and to help fund a few things for our upcoming baby 🐣.

## 🖼️ What You'll Find Here

Each painting listed includes:
- A high-quality photo
- Title, medium, and size
- A price (suggested donation)

If you see something you love, please don’t hesitate to reach out — it would mean a lot to us to know her art has found a good home.

## 💌 How to Purchase

Just contact us directly via email or message — we’re keeping this simple and informal, among friends. Payments can be handled via [PayPal] or in person.

Local pickup can be arranged individually.

## 💡 About the Project

This site is a simple gallery built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). We wanted a clean, fast-loading way to share her work privately.

## 🙏 Thanks

Thanks so much for checking it out. Whether you decide to purchase something or just enjoy the art, your support means the world to us.

With love,  
Baris & Zana
